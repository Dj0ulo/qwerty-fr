xkb-qwerty-fr (0.7.3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Layout: Replaced 〉 with ⟩ in the math mode. i.e. “Right Angle
    Bracket” was replaced with “Mathematical Right Angle Bracket”.
    〉 is the “Right Angle Bracket” but we actually want ⟩ which is the
    “Mathematical Right Angle Bracket”.
  * Linux: Removed parasitic .DS_Store/__MACOSX/DEBIAN files from the Linux
    package.
  * Linux: Changed the separator characters used in keymap.txt to improve
    readability. Credits go to https://github.com/eclipseo
